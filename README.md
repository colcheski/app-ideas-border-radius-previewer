# Border Radius Previewer

Suggested project from https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas

***I am running through all of the suggested projects in the aforementioned repo as a way to keep my skills sharp and sure up any weak points***

A page to fiddle with border radius values and copy the css of the changes to the clipboard.

***Note: I have added some TODOs to this for things to make the page look/behave better if I decide to go back through these and do any refactoring***
